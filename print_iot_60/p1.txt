Q1. To interface LED with Arduino and write a program to turn ON/OFF LED light at interval of every 1 Sec.

#define LED_BUILTIN 7
void setup()
 {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN,OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,HIGH);
  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,LOW);
  delay(1000);
  

}
